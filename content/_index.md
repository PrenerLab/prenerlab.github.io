### Join the Research Team
I am always looking for motivated students who want to gain some research experience. As of Fall 2018, I do not have any additional paid positions on my research team - all involvement is on a voluntary basis. If you are interested in joing my research team, please [email me](mailto:chris.prener@slu.edu). If you are a prospective student, feel free to [email me](mailto:chris.prener@slu.edu) but you will need to apply for admission to the University as well.

### Active Projects
You can see a full list of the projects that I am working on <a href="https://chris-prener.github.io/#projects" target="_blank">on my website</a>. At the present time, I have students working on two of these projects:

* <a href="https://chris-prener.github.io/project/ecometrics/" target="_blank">Ecometric St. Louis</a> - all three of the major strands of the project (arson, <a href="https://chris-prener.github.io/barriers/" target="_blank">barriers</a>, and <a href="https://chris-prener.github.io/vacancy/" target="_blank">urban prairies</a>) have student collaborators. There is room for additional students to participate on both technical tasks (if you know a bit of `R` or GIS) or on non-technical tasks.
* <a href="https://chris-prener.github.io/project/opengis/" target="_blank">openGIS</a> - both major strands of the project (data and software development) have student collaborators. There is room for additional students to participate, but it requires having some exposure to `R` and/or GIS.
